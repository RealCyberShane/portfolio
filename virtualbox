# Installing Windows On Virtual Box

To begin this project, I need to get Windows 10 on my Virtual Box. To do this, I need a windows iso file.

First, I go to the windows website so I can download the widnows 10 ISO file.

I make sure I download the ISO file and not anything else.

Next, I created a new VM to install the ISO on.

  I have a low end computer so I have the VM minimal computing power.

  After creating the VM, I launch it and it tells me to install the ISO, which I then locate the ISO file for installation.

    Once finished, I go through the windows installation wizard to install windows onto my VM.

    I made sure to install Windows 10 Pro
